# Multitask Convolutional Neural Net for Food Embeddings

Training a convolutional neural net to recognize from any food image 1) all its ingredients, 2) its category, and 3) its recipe complexity (approximated by the number of recipe steps) using MITâ€™s Recipe1M dataset. Using food embeddings from this CNN to take an image of food someone's craving and find local restaurants selling food with the most similar embedding.
